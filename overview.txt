Enhancing Urban EV Charging Networks: A Case Study of Bhubaneswar
This repository contains the research paper and related materials focused on strategically optimizing the placement of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.

Overview
With the increasing adoption of electric vehicles in Bhubaneswar, there is a growing need for a well-distributed and efficient EV charging infrastructure. This research integrates geospatial analytics and machine learning with advanced optimization techniques to propose scalable charging station locations that meet the city’s energy and transportation demands.

Key methodologies include:

Geospatial Analysis: Using QGIS for detailed mapping and urban spatial data visualization.
Demand Clustering: Applying Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to identify high-demand regions for charging stations based on various spatial and behavioral data.
Optimization Algorithms: Utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Shortest Distance Method (SDM) for optimal site selection considering factors like grid proximity, regional coverage, and user accessibility.
